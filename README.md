# Hello there! I'm **Jeacovy Gayle**.

###### **A bit about myself (***duped from my Linkedin profile***):** ðŸ¥¸

My goal is to spend my career building great software by directing and managing engineering teams as a hybrid team player ranging from system designer, people manager, roadmap satisfaction driver, project manager and innovative problem solver.

Using language agnostic paradigm as the forefront to my software architecting and design decisions in addition to 8+ years of experience allow me to lead engineering teams. Teams that balance design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of complex software and technology projects. I value the ability to meet and exceed the expectations of both the company and stakeholders for each project my team encompasses.

In order to motivate and manage team growth and professional development, I continue to draw from a deep and broad technical background to mentor fellow engineers and provide guidance in addition to exposing myself to new forms of technologies.

###### **My favorite quote:**
> I'd rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right.
