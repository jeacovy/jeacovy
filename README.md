# Hello there! I'm Jeacovy Gayle.

## About Me

I am committed to producing top-quality software throughout my career by leading and managing engineering teams in various positions. With over nine years of experience, I have developed a programming language-neutral approach to software architecture and design that helps engineering teams maintain an equilibrium between creating, coding, testing, launching, and supporting complex technological projects. My goal is always to surpass a company's and stakeholders' expectations for every project my teams undertake.

I prioritize nurturing team growth and professional development by utilizing my extensive technical background to help mentor other engineers and provide guidance. Additionally, I stay abreast of emerging technologies to remain informed and up-to-date.
